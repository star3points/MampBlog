Model–View–Controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces<br>
which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of<br>
information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Following the MVC architectural pattern<br>
decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development.<br>
